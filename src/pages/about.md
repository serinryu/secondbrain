# Hello 
Hi, this is Serin Ryu 👋

### Where I am writing
1. ✍🏻 On [this website](https://secondbrain-puce.vercel.app), I write about key concepts of software development. This is my WIKI  containing the most essential and important tech information that would be foundation of my development journey. The topics are OOP, Java, Network, Web, and so on. 
2. 📠 On [my blog](https://medium.com/@serin0404), I write about personal growth and entrepreneurship, tech trend, as well as insights/lessons/thoughts as a developer. Also, you can check the summaries of the books I have read.
3. 💌 On Instagram or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/serinryu), I share my insights about business, trend, personal growth & mindset, or anything I’m interested in.
