# Who am I
Hey, this is Serin Ryu 👋

## What I like

- 🎡 **I like systemizing the workload.**
  - I believe that the better the system, the better and easier working process and business will be. Although creating a system may feel overwhelming at first, it eventually saves time and brings efficiency, productivity, and creativity. Therefore, I consider it important to explicitly define the rules for how the system works.
- 🔭 **I like R&D(Research and Development).** 
  - I’m always thinking about catering to new wants or needs in the market. I carefully evaluate new technologies and choose what best fits the project objectives. I also look forward to how much new technology will help the business and how much productivity will increase.
- 🖋️ **I like organizing what I’ve learned and sharing it.**
  - As [Brian Tracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5I85_YAak) says, “Good habits are hard to form but easy to live with. Bad habits are easy to form but hard to live with.” Even though it is time consuming process at first, I strongly believe it constantly develops me like fuel.
- 📚 **I like learning.**
  - Tech is an incredibly dynamic and fluid industry. It’s constantly growing, changing and evolving. As a member of the industry, I try to stay current and up-to-date with the industry and new technologies. I adopt a continuous improvement mindset and believe a small adjustment in your work means big results.

## Where I am writing

‘Absolute’ means independent, permanent and not subject to qualification. ‘Absolute Truth’ is the ineffable and unchanging truth that transcends all concepts and language.

‘Relative’ means partial or transient, dependent on circumstances or point-of-view. ‘Relative truth’ is anything that describes the changing phenomena of our experience.

I envisioned a two-way system which stores two different types of information each.  I'm excited to show you the embodiment of this vision: my [Second Brain](https://mysecondbrain.vercel.app/) for 'absolute truth', and my [Medium blog](https://serinryu.medium.com/) for 'relative truth'. Read more below.


### ✍🏻 [Second Brain](https://mysecondbrain.vercel.app/)
This is my research note. This contains the key concepts that run through the core technology. It's not just a how-to, it's about the underlying principles that make it work. The topics are OOP, Java, Network, Web, and so on.

### 📠 [Medium Blog](https://serinryu.medium.com/)
This contains what I want to share among new information I’ve learned or an experience I’ve done. 
1. Tech Trends : I write about tech trend or my experience with new technology I’ve tried. 
2. Insights & Tips : I write about my insights/lessons/thoughts on personal growth, entrepreneurship, and as a developer.
3. Book Notes. : I write summaries of the books I have read.


### 💌 Instagram & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/serinryu)
If you feel they are too lengthy(TL;DR), check my instagram and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/serinryu). On Instagram and Twitter, I share my short insights about business, trend, personal growth & mindset, or anything I’m interested in.
