# Web Server (feat.Nginx)

## Web Server VS WAS

![img](https://i.ibb.co/my7Hwwm/image.png)

1. **Web Server**: The web server is responsible for handling client requests and serving static content (e.g., .html, .png, .css files). When a client sends an HTTP request, the web server processes it, serves static content directly, and relays dynamic content requests to the Web Application Server (WAS).
2. **Web Application Server (WAS)**: The WAS processes dynamic content, which involves business logic and data retrieval from the database. It generates dynamic responses based on the client's request and returns the results to the web server, which then sends the response back to the client.
    - WAS can function independently and handle both static and dynamic content, but it is more commonly used for processing dynamic content and offloading such tasks from the web server.
    - Some frameworks, like Node.js with Express.js, can act as both a web server and a WAS, simplifying the architecture for smaller applications.
    - Notable examples of WAS include Tomcat, JBoss, Jeus, and WebSphere.

## Why Web Server and WAS?

- **Web Server**: A web server is used to **efficiently serve static content directly to clients**, reducing the load on the application server (WAS). It helps optimize resource usage and speeds up the process of delivering static resources like images, stylesheets, etc.
- **Web Application Server (WAS)**: **Dynamic content,** such as personalized data and business logic, requires processing on the server-side. The WAS handles these dynamic requests, retrieving data from the database, and generating responses based on the client's requirements. By using a dedicated application server for this purpose, resources can be utilized more efficiently, and the server can handle a larger number of requests from multiple clients.

## üç±¬†Reasons for Separating Web Server and WAS

1. **Load Distribution**: Web Servers efficiently handle static content, while WAS focuses on processing dynamic content and database access. Separating these functions allows for better load distribution, reducing the burden on each server and improving overall performance.
    - The web server serves static content directly, reducing the load on the backend.
2. **Enhanced Security**: Physically separating the Web Server from the WAS strengthens security by preventing direct access to the WAS, limiting potential vulnerabilities.
    - Backend port numbers are hidden, enhancing security by reducing direct exposure to clients.
3. **Scalability with Load Balancing**: By placing Web Servers in front of multiple WAS instances and using load balancing techniques, the system can handle increased traffic and scale out as needed. Load balancing evenly distributes requests among WAS instances, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
    - Load balancing allows adding multiple backend instances and distributing requests efficiently.
4. **Facilitating Maintenance and Updates**: Separating the functionalities makes maintenance and updates easier. It allows for independent management of Web Servers and WAS, minimizing disruptions during updates or upgrades.

Overall, separating the roles of Web Server and WAS in a Web Service Architecture offers benefits in terms of performance, security, scalability, and maintenance.

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†**Real Life Example**

### Architecture without Web Server (Option 1)

1. **Development Environment**:
    - During development, frontend (React + Typescript) and backend (Spring Boot) are typically run as separate servers.
    - React development server runs on one port (e.g., 3000), and Spring development server runs on another port (e.g., 8080).
    - This separation allows independent testing and debugging of the frontend and backend.
2. **Production Environment**:
    - Frontend and backend deployed as separate servers.
    - Separate URLs for frontend (3000) and backend (8080) services.
    - No load balancing or reverse proxy, resulting in increased backend load.
    - Backend port numbers are directly exposed.
3. **Challenges**:
    - Increased backend load: Backend handles both dynamic and static content, potentially leading to performance issues.
    - Security concerns: Direct exposure of backend port numbers may pose security risks.
    - Scalability limitations: Difficult to scale efficiently without load balancing.
    - Maintenance complexities: Updates and scalability may require more effort.
    

### Architecture with Web Server (Option 2)

1. **Development Environment**:
    - During development, frontend (React + Typescript) and backend (Spring Boot) are typically run as separate servers.
    - React development server runs on one port (e.g., 3000), and Spring development server runs on another port (e.g., 8080).
    - This separation allows independent testing and debugging of the frontend and backend.
2. **Production Environment**:
    - In the production environment, it is common to use a web server (e.g., Nginx) to integrate the frontend and backend into a single service.
    - The web server acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests between React and Spring based on the request URL.
    - Requests with "/api/" are forwarded to the backend (e.g., 8080 port), while other requests are sent to the frontend (e.g., 3000 port).
    - This setup allows deploying frontend and backend as separate web applications accessible through a unified domain (e.g., example.com).
3. **Benefits**:
    - Load distribution: Frontend serves static content directly, reducing backend load.
    - Security: Backend port numbers are concealed, improving security.
    - Scalability: Load balancing allows adding multiple backend instances for increased capacity.
    - Convenience: Easier maintenance, updates, and scalability.

**Conclusion**:
Using a web server in the architecture (Option 2) offers significant advantages, including better load distribution, improved security, scalability, and easier maintenance. It enables a more efficient and robust deployment, enhancing the overall performance of the web application. In contrast, not using a web server (Option 1) may lead to increased backend load, security vulnerabilities, and scalability limitations, making it less preferable for production environments.

Here's an example of how Nginx, React, and each backend microservice (implemented using Spring Boot) handle incoming requests, assuming React runs on port 3000 and the backend microservice runs on port 8080:

1. **Nginx (Port: 80)**:
    
    Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests for the React application and backend microservice appropriately.
    
    For example, when a user accesses `example.com`, Nginx routes the request to the React application.
    
    ```xml
    http {
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name example.com;
    
            location / {
                proxy_pass <http://localhost:3000>; # Routes to the React application
            }
    
            # Other configurations...
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **React Application (Port: 3000)**:
    
    The React application runs on port 3000 and is served through Nginx for the frontend.
    
    For example, when a user accesses `example.com`, Nginx routes the request to the React application, and the React homepage is displayed.
    
3. **Spring Boot Microservice (Port: 8080)**:
    
    The Spring Boot backend microservice runs on port 8080, and API requests are handled through the API Gateway.
    
    For example, when a user accesses `example.com/api`, the API request is routed through the API Gateway to the backend microservice.
    
    ```jsx
    @RestController
    public class ExampleController {
        @GetMapping("/api/hello")
        public String hello() {
            return "Hello from Spring Boot Microservice!";
        }
    }
    ```
    
    The above example shows a simple Spring Boot controller with the `/api/hello` endpoint. When a request comes to `example.com/api/hello`, it is routed through the API Gateway to this endpoint, and the response "Hello from Spring Boot Microservice!" is returned.
    

In this setup, Nginx routes requests to either the React application or the backend microservice through the API Gateway, enabling a separation of concerns and a clear distinction between frontend and backend in the architecture.

## üëÅÔ∏è **Overall Architecture**

![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/xzrSSrC/b.png)

In summary, let me explain the overall architecture of the web application developed using React and Spring:

1. **Client (Frontend):**
    - Frontend is developed using React.
    - It creates the user interface (UI) and renders screens using components.
    - It handles user inputs and requests necessary data from the server for rendering.
    - It operates within web browsers and can be developed using the React development server.
2. **Server (Backend):**
    - Backend is developed using Spring.
    - It accepts and processes HTTP requests from the client.
    - It handles business logic and interacts with the database.
    - It defines API endpoints to provide data to the client.
3. **Web Server:**
    - In the production environment, React and Spring can be integrated to build a web server.
    - The web server receives HTTP requests from the client and routes requests between React and Spring as needed.
    - It integrates the client and backend into a single service.
    - Web servers like Nginx, Apache, etc., can be used for this purpose.
