# Welcome üëãüèª 

Hey, welcome to my research note! ü•≥


Each technology has its own history and pose challenges and questions. How were they created? Why were they used? Who pays for it? What's been left out? What are the differences between the conventional one and the current one? 

I envisioned a selection of truth about technology that would be a fundation of my projects and research. I launched this site not only to create a single archive for that but also to make it freely accessible. I am thrilled to present you with this archive.üî≠

This contains the key concepts that penetrate core technology. This is not about simple how-to articles, but the basic principles it's basically working on. 

:::caution
This is of course simply a small selection of the vast amount of truth that is out there. You will know more about what is available in your own area of specialism, and Google or ChatGPT will uncover more. There are also numerous official sources, both general and specialised. I want to make sure that I curate most of information from **official documents**, which mean you can get more specific information from there. If you want to recommend something or there is any issue, please contact me.
