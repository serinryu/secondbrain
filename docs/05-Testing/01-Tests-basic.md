# Tests (Unit Tests, Integration Tests, UI Tests)

## Unit Tests

- Focus on testing individual units or components of code in isolation.
- Test a single function, method, or class with all its dependencies mocked or stubbed.
- Aim to verify the correctness of the behavior of a specific unit of code.
- Typically executed quickly, as they don't involve complex setups or external resources.
- Provide fast feedback during development, making it easier to locate and fix bugs.
- Help ensure the stability and maintainability of the codebase by catching issues early.

### Unit Testing in MVC Pattern
In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, dependencies exist between different layers in the hierarchical structure. Therefore, when designing unit tests, it is important to disconnect these dependencies in order to test each layer independently.

## Integration Tests

- Focus on testing the interaction and integration between multiple components or modules.
- Test the collaboration and compatibility of various units and their interactions with external dependencies (e.g., databases, external services, APIs).
- Involve running the code in a more realistic environment, often with actual dependencies or external resources.
- Aim to uncover issues that may arise due to the integration of different components or subsystems.
- Require more setup time and may take longer to execute compared to unit tests.
- Validate the system's behavior as a whole and help ensure its overall functionality and correctness.
- TheÂ `@SpringBootTest`Â annotation is useful in Integration Tests because it helps to bootstrap the entire container.


> Unit tests provide rapid feedback and isolate issues within specific units, while integration tests verify the system's behavior as a whole and help ensure the interoperability of different components. Both types of tests are valuable and should be used in combination to achieve comprehensive test coverage.


## UI Tests (E2E Tests)

- This refers to testing the system based on end to end user flows, instead of testing the system has separate components like in unit testing or story level testing. For example - Logging into the application, then adding a product to the shopping cart, then going to the check out screen and then placing an order and then logging out of the application could be one user flow.
